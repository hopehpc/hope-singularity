# This recipe is for amber serial and mpi - CPU only
# Note that the mpich inside the container must be 
#    'compatable with' the mpich that is installed
#    on the host. I don't know what this means so I
#    am assuming they must be exactly the same.
# See https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide.pdf for info about
#    building and running using 'hybrid'

# The serial build (without MPICH) takes about 40 minutes. Sif file is 1.2GB
# Approximate timins:
#    Building serial 45 mins
#    Buliding MPI 
#    Testing AmberTools serial
#    Testing amber serial
